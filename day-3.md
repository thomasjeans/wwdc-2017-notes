## Day 3: Wednesday June 7, 2017

### Session 404 - Debugging with Xcode 9

#### Wireless Development
No more fighting over lightning cables

This will be good for AR, VR, and camera app development

Support for tvOS too

Quicktime supported wirelessly on tvOS for screen sharing

There is a Connect via Network option in Devices screen

You can connect via IP address for "complex" networks

Brave live demo of hitting a breakpoint wirelessly. At this point, they can stop selling it. We are all going to use this from now until forever anyway

There are some nice minor improvements to Instruments like the ability to transfer a debugging session and pin a track to the bottom to align it with other lanes

#### Breakpoints
Code completion added to debugging conditions and actions

Breakpoints show you if they have options set

Breakpoint navigator deep filtering

#### View Controller Debugging
View Controllers show up in the navigator under the square hotdog

SpriteKit and SceneKit are now first class citizens in the view debugger

Memory graph debugger is built with SpriteKit and the visual debugger uses SceneKit!!!

#### Summary
##### Not much substance here. If you're expecting a deep dive into LLDB and hardcore debugging, you won't find it in this session. Nice love shown to SpriteKit and Scenekit.

### Session 212 - What's New in Foundation
:construction:

### Session 802 - Essential Design Principles
The session speaks for itself and notes won't really do it justice

They discussed in detail the design principles of:
- Wayfinding
- Feedback
- Visibility
- Consistency
- Mental Model
- Proximity
- Grouping
- Mapping
- Affordance
- Progressive Disclosure
- 80/20 Rule
- Symmetry

Loved this quote, "When a system breaks out mental model, we perceive it to be unintuitive."

All of these principles allow users to:
- feel safe
- understnad
- achieve
- experience beauty and joy

#### Summary
##### This was a very cool session that should be a must watch for any engineer working on front end development (or API design). I plan to use this as a reference for high level UX best practices for a long time to come.
