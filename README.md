## Summary
This was a pretty eventful WWDC. Apple announced some innovative new features and APIs as well as a surprising amount of new hardware.

As an iPad developer, I can't wait to dig deeper into the iPad productivity features like the new dock and drag and drop included in iOS 11. I am excited about the possibilities that CoreML and ARKit will bring. The new image and video compression standards seem like a wise move. On the hardware front, the iMac Pro is looking like a beast. I'll reserve judgement on the HomePod but the price point, pudgy physical design, and the lack of details on SDKs are concerning.

The inclusion of a fireside chat with Michelle Obama was a very cool treat. Fallout Boy played at The Bash and they put on a great show. Apple really goes out of their way to make the conference a memorable experience for attendees and the Apple engineers who work tirelessly to bring these cool new products to market.

This was my second WWDC and despite all of the impactful announcements that were made this year and in 2015, my favorite part of both conferences was the chance to hang out with friends and co-workers and to be immersed in the incredibly friendly and diverse Apple developer community for the week.
